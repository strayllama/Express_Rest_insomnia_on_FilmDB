Express Homework
Take a look through the start code, there are dummy data models provided instead of a database.

Using the films data model to access the data, create the appropriate routes to serve this data from our RESTful express API.

Show all films with an index route (GET /films)
Get film by ID / index (GET /films/:id)
Add a new film with a create route (POST /films) You will need body-parser to access the body of the incoming requests
Update an existing film with an update route (UPDATE /films/:id);
Delete a film using it's ID / index (DELETE /films:id)
You'll need to use Insomnia to test your CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE routes. You can test GET routes with your browser's address bar.

Extension
Set up another controller for a Books API. You can access some data for this using the BooksData class.

Remember to use the npm run server:dev script to use nodemon to automatically restart the server to apply your changes as you save your files.
